# Work-Day-Scheduler-Project
A webpage containing a work day scheduler

In this project, we were given a starter code from that we were to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The app is to run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The app has to meet the following user story:

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

The app also has to meet the following acceptance criteria:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

And finally, the app has to look like the mock-up belwo:

I did come up with the app and you can use the deployment link below to view the app:
